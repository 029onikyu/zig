comptime calling fn with inferred error set should give empty error set but still you can use try

comptime err to int of empty err set and of size 1 err set

comptime test for err


undefined in infer error 

syntax -  ?a!b  should be ?(a!b) but it's (?a)!b

syntax - (error{}!void) as the return type


passing a fn()error{}!T to a fn()error!T should be a compile error, they're not compatible
