 * use a hash map for instructions because the array is too big
   - no, actually modify the Zir.Inst.Ref strategy so that each decl gets
     their indexes starting at 0 so that we can use an array to store Sema
     results rather than a map.

 * in SwitchProng resolve, make sure AST tree gets loaded.
   It will be unloaded if using cached ZIR.
