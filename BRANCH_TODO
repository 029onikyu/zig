Scratch pad for stuff to do before merging master
=================================================

uncomment all the behavior tests
diff master branch to make sure

restore bootstrap.zig to master

get an empty file compiling successfully (with no panic fn override)

better behavior for implicit casts. for example these introduce an extra allocation/memcpy:
    var x: [1]i32 = [_]i32{1};
    var x = ([1]i32)([_]i32{1});
whereas this one does not:
    var x = [_]i32{1};
but all 3 should be semantically identical


This example has less than ideal LLVM IR:
```zig
export fn entry() void {
    _ = mul(true, 1) catch undefined;
}
pub fn mul(c: bool, answer: i32) error{Overflow}!i32 {
    return if (c) error.Overflow else answer;
}
```
It creates an unnecessary stack variable.
