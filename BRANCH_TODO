Scratch pad for stuff to do before merging master
=================================================

get an empty file compiling successfully (with no panic fn override)

uncomment all the behavior tests

look at all the ir_gen_node ir_gen_node_extra calls and make sure result locations are properly propagated
            return ir_gen_comptime(irb, scope, node, lval);
