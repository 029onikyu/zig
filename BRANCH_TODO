=================================================

restore test_runner.zig to master branch
 - also the default panic function and unexpected_error_tracing. see the commit
   that adds this text to BRANCH_TODO file.
 - and std/specia/bootstrap.zig

get an empty file compiling successfully (with no panic fn override)

uncomment all the behavior tests
