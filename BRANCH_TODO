Scratch pad for stuff to do before merging master
=================================================

restore test_runner.zig to master branch
 - also the default panic function and unexpected_error_tracing. see the commit
   that adds this text to BRANCH_TODO file.
 - and std/specia/bootstrap.zig

get an empty file compiling successfully (with no panic fn override)

uncomment all the behavior tests

better behavior for implicit casts. for example these introduce an extra allocation/memcpy:
    var x: [1]i32 = [_]i32{1};
    var x = ([1]i32)([_]i32{1});
whereas this one does not:
    var x = [_]i32{1};
but all 3 should be semantically identical
