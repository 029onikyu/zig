Scratch pad for stuff to do before merging master
=================================================

look at all the ir_gen_node ir_gen_node_extra calls and make sure result locations are properly propagated

migrate all the alloca_list to alloca_gen_list

migrate ir_build_var_decl_src to use ir_build_alloca_src and explicitly initialize

inferred comptime


    if (lval == LValNone) {
        if (result_loc->id == ResultLocIdNone)
            return value;
    }

    assert(lval == LValPtr);

    // We needed a pointer to a value, but we got a value. So we create
    // an instruction which just makes a pointer of it.
    return ir_build_ref(irb, scope, value->source_node, value, false, false);

handle if with no else

audit usage of LVal because that's when ir_lval_wrap is not called which now has build_end_expr
